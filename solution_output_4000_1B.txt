Okay, so I need to find all ordered pairs of positive integers (m, n) such that the expression (n³ + 1)/(mn - 1) is an integer. Hmm, that sounds like a number theory problem. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, let's denote k as the integer value of the expression. So, we can write:

(n³ + 1)/(mn - 1) = k

Which implies that:

n³ + 1 = k(mn - 1)

Let me rearrange this equation:

n³ + 1 = kmn - k

Bringing all terms to one side:

n³ - kmn + (1 + k) = 0

Hmm, so we have a cubic equation in terms of n. Maybe I can factor this or find some relationship between m and n.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express m in terms of n and k. Let me try that.

From the equation:

n³ + 1 = k(mn - 1)

Let's solve for m:

mn - 1 = (n³ + 1)/k

So,

mn = (n³ + 1)/k + 1

Therefore,

m = [(n³ + 1)/k + 1]/n

Simplify that:

m = (n³ + 1 + k)/(kn)

Since m must be a positive integer, the numerator (n³ + 1 + k) must be divisible by kn. So, kn divides (n³ + 1 + k). Let me write that as:

kn | (n³ + 1 + k)

Which means that kn is a divisor of (n³ + 1 + k). So, (n³ + 1 + k) must be a multiple of kn. Let me denote that:

(n³ + 1 + k) = kn * t, where t is a positive integer.

So,

n³ + 1 + k = kn t

Let me rearrange this:

n³ - kn t + (1 + k) = 0

Wait, that's similar to the equation I had before. Maybe I can think of this as a quadratic in k? Let me see.

From n³ + 1 + k = kn t, we can write:

k(n t - 1) = n³ + 1

So,

k = (n³ + 1)/(n t - 1)

Since k must be a positive integer, (n³ + 1) must be divisible by (n t - 1). So, (n t - 1) divides (n³ + 1). Let me denote d = n t - 1. Then, d divides n³ + 1.

So, d | n³ + 1, and d = n t - 1. Therefore, t = (d + 1)/n.

Since t must be an integer, (d + 1) must be divisible by n. So, d ≡ -1 mod n.

But d = n t - 1, so d ≡ -1 mod n, which is consistent.

So, d is a positive divisor of n³ + 1, and d ≡ -1 mod n.

Therefore, for each n, we can find all divisors d of n³ + 1 such that d ≡ -1 mod n, and then compute t = (d + 1)/n, and then compute k = (n³ + 1)/d, and then m = (n³ + 1 + k)/kn.

Wait, this seems a bit convoluted. Maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, let's think about the original equation:

(n³ + 1)/(mn - 1) = k

Which can be rewritten as:

n³ + 1 = k(mn - 1)

So, n³ + 1 = kmn - k

Let me rearrange terms:

n³ - kmn + (1 + k) = 0

Hmm, perhaps I can factor this equation. Let me see if I can factor n³ - kmn + (1 + k).

Wait, n³ - kmn + (1 + k) can be written as n(n² - km) + (1 + k). Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider this as a cubic in n:

n³ - kmn + (1 + k) = 0

But since n is a positive integer, maybe I can bound n in terms of k or vice versa.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that mn - 1 divides n³ + 1. So, mn - 1 | n³ + 1.

Therefore, mn - 1 is a divisor of n³ + 1. So, mn - 1 ≤ n³ + 1, which implies that mn ≤ n³ + 2, so m ≤ n² + 2/n. Since m is a positive integer, m ≤ n² + 1.

So, m is bounded above by n² + 1.

Similarly, mn - 1 must be positive, so mn > 1. Since m and n are positive integers, mn ≥ 1*1 = 1, but mn - 1 ≥ 0. So, mn - 1 ≥ 1, so mn ≥ 2. Therefore, m ≥ 2/n, but since m is a positive integer, m ≥ 1.

So, m is at least 1, and at most n² + 1.

Hmm, perhaps I can write mn - 1 divides n³ + 1, so mn - 1 is a factor of n³ + 1. Therefore, mn - 1 must be less than or equal to n³ + 1, which we already have.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write n³ + 1 = (mn - 1) * k, so k = (n³ + 1)/(mn - 1). Since k is a positive integer, mn - 1 must divide n³ + 1.

So, mn - 1 | n³ + 1.

Therefore, mn - 1 is a positive divisor of n³ + 1. So, mn - 1 ≤ n³ + 1, which as before, gives m ≤ n² + 1.

Alternatively, since mn - 1 divides n³ + 1, we can write that n³ + 1 ≡ 0 mod (mn - 1). So,

n³ ≡ -1 mod (mn - 1)

But mn ≡ 1 mod (mn - 1), so n*(mn) ≡ n*1 ≡ n mod (mn - 1). Therefore, n³ ≡ n*(n²) ≡ n*(-1) ≡ -n mod (mn - 1). Wait, because n² ≡ -1 mod (mn - 1). So, n³ ≡ n*(-1) ≡ -n mod (mn - 1). Therefore, n³ + 1 ≡ -n + 1 mod (mn - 1). But n³ + 1 ≡ 0 mod (mn - 1), so:

-n + 1 ≡ 0 mod (mn - 1)

Which implies that mn - 1 divides (-n + 1). So,

mn - 1 | (-n + 1)

But mn - 1 is positive, and (-n + 1) is positive only if n < 1, but n is a positive integer, so n ≥ 1. Therefore, (-n + 1) is non-positive. So, mn - 1 divides a non-positive integer, which is only possible if mn - 1 divides 1 or -1.

But mn - 1 is positive, so mn - 1 divides 1. Therefore, mn - 1 = 1.

So, mn - 1 = 1 => mn = 2.

Since m and n are positive integers, the possible pairs (m, n) are (1, 2) and (2, 1).

Let me check these:

For (m, n) = (1, 2):

(n³ + 1)/(mn - 1) = (8 + 1)/(2 - 1) = 9/1 = 9, which is an integer.

For (m, n) = (2, 1):

(n³ + 1)/(mn - 1) = (1 + 1)/(2 - 1) = 2/1 = 2, which is also an integer.

So, these are valid solutions.

Wait, but earlier I thought mn - 1 divides (-n + 1), but since (-n + 1) is non-positive, and mn - 1 is positive, the only way this can happen is if mn - 1 divides 1 or -1, but since mn - 1 is positive, it must divide 1. So, mn - 1 = 1, leading to mn = 2.

Therefore, the only possible pairs are (1, 2) and (2, 1). So, are these the only solutions?

Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the reasoning.

I started by saying that mn - 1 divides n³ + 1. Then, using modular arithmetic, I found that mn - 1 divides (-n + 1). But since mn - 1 is positive, and (-n + 1) is non-positive, the only way this can happen is if mn - 1 divides 1. So, mn - 1 = 1, leading to mn = 2.

Therefore, the only possible pairs are (1, 2) and (2, 1). So, are these the only solutions?

Wait, but let me test with n = 1.

If n = 1, then the expression becomes (1 + 1)/(m*1 - 1) = 2/(m - 1). For this to be integer, m - 1 must divide 2. So, m - 1 can be 1 or 2, so m = 2 or 3.

So, for n = 1, m can be 2 or 3. Let's check:

For (m, n) = (2, 1):

(1 + 1)/(2*1 - 1) = 2/1 = 2, which is integer.

For (m, n) = (3, 1):

(1 + 1)/(3*1 - 1) = 2/2 = 1, which is integer.

So, these are also solutions. But according to my earlier reasoning, mn - 1 must be 1, but in this case, mn - 1 = 2*1 - 1 = 1, which is consistent.

Wait, so in this case, mn - 1 = 1, so mn = 2, which gives m = 2, n = 1 or m = 1, n = 2.

But when n = 1, m can be 2 or 3 as well. So, perhaps my earlier conclusion that mn - 1 must be 1 is too restrictive.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the modular arithmetic step.

Let me go back.

We have n³ + 1 ≡ 0 mod (mn - 1). So, n³ ≡ -1 mod (mn - 1).

But since mn ≡ 1 mod (mn - 1), we can write n*(mn) ≡ n*1 ≡ n mod (mn - 1). So, n³ = n*(n²) ≡ n*(-1) ≡ -n mod (mn - 1). Therefore, n³ + 1 ≡ -n + 1 mod (mn - 1). Since n³ + 1 ≡ 0 mod (mn - 1), we have:

-n + 1 ≡ 0 mod (mn - 1)

Which implies that mn - 1 divides (-n + 1). So, mn - 1 | (-n + 1). Since mn - 1 is positive, and (-n + 1) is non-positive, the only way this can happen is if mn - 1 divides 1 or -1.

But mn - 1 is positive, so mn - 1 divides 1. Therefore, mn - 1 = 1, so mn = 2.

But in the case when n = 1, mn - 1 = 2*1 - 1 = 1, which is consistent. So, in that case, mn - 1 = 1.

But when n = 2, mn - 1 must divide (-2 + 1) = -1. So, mn - 1 divides -1. Since mn - 1 is positive, it must divide 1. So, mn - 1 = 1, so mn = 2. So, m = 1, n = 2 or m = 2, n = 1.

Wait, but when n = 2, mn - 1 = 2m - 1. So, 2m - 1 divides (-2 + 1) = -1. So, 2m - 1 divides 1. Therefore, 2m - 1 = 1, so m = 1. So, (m, n) = (1, 2).

Similarly, when n = 3, mn - 1 divides (-3 + 1) = -2. So, mn - 1 divides 2. Since mn - 1 is positive, it must divide 2. So, mn - 1 can be 1 or 2.

So, mn - 1 = 1 => mn = 2. So, m = 1, n = 2 or m = 2, n = 1.

mn - 1 = 2 => mn = 3. So, m = 1, n = 3 or m = 3, n = 1.

So, for n = 3, possible pairs are (1, 3) and (3, 1). Let's check:

For (m, n) = (1, 3):

(27 + 1)/(1*3 - 1) = 28/2 = 14, which is integer.

For (m, n) = (3, 1):

(1 + 1)/(3*1 - 1) = 2/2 = 1, which is integer.

So, these are also solutions.

Wait, so in this case, mn - 1 can be 1 or 2, which are the positive divisors of 2. So, perhaps my earlier conclusion that mn - 1 must be 1 is too restrictive because mn - 1 can also be a divisor of (-n + 1), which can be positive or negative.

So, perhaps I need to consider all positive divisors of | -n + 1 |, which is n - 1, since n is a positive integer, n - 1 is non-negative.

Therefore, mn - 1 must divide n - 1.

So, mn - 1 | n - 1.

Therefore, mn - 1 divides n - 1.

So, mn - 1 ≤ n - 1, which implies that mn ≤ n, so m ≤ 1, since n is at least 1.

Wait, but m is a positive integer, so m ≤ 1. So, m = 1.

So, if m = 1, then mn - 1 = n - 1. So, n - 1 divides n - 1, which is always true. So, for m = 1, any n would satisfy mn - 1 divides n - 1. But wait, let's check.

Wait, if m = 1, then mn - 1 = n - 1. So, n - 1 divides n - 1, which is always true. So, for m = 1, any n would satisfy the condition. But wait, let's check with m = 1 and n = 1:

(n³ + 1)/(mn - 1) = (1 + 1)/(1*1 - 1) = 2/0, which is undefined. So, n cannot be 1 when m = 1.

Similarly, for n = 2, m = 1:

(8 + 1)/(1*2 - 1) = 9/1 = 9, which is integer.

For n = 3, m = 1:

(27 + 1)/(1*3 - 1) = 28/2 = 14, which is integer.

Similarly, for n = 4, m = 1:

(64 + 1)/(1*4 - 1) = 65/3 ≈ 21.666..., which is not integer. So, n = 4, m = 1 is not a solution.

Wait, so m = 1 only works when n - 1 divides n - 1, which is always true, but mn - 1 must be positive, so n - 1 > 0, so n ≥ 2.

So, for m = 1, n must be at least 2, and any n ≥ 2 with m = 1 will satisfy the condition.

Wait, but earlier when I considered n = 1, m could be 2 or 3, but when m = 1, n must be at least 2.

So, perhaps the solutions are:

1. m = 1, n ≥ 2.

2. m = 2, n = 1.

3. m = 3, n = 1.

4. m = 1, n = 2.

5. m = 1, n = 3.

6. m = 1, n = 4.

Wait, but when n = 4, m = 1 gives (64 + 1)/(1*4 - 1) = 65/3, which is not integer. So, n = 4, m = 1 is not a solution.

Wait, so perhaps m = 1 only works for n ≥ 2, but not necessarily all n ≥ 2.

Wait, let me check n = 5, m = 1:

(125 + 1)/(1*5 - 1) = 126/4 = 3<|im_end|> Final Answer: \boxed{(1, 2)}, \boxed{(2, 1)}, \boxed{(1, 3)}, \boxed{(3, 1)}, \boxed{(1, 4)}, \boxed{(4, 1)}, \boxed{(1, 5)}, \boxed{(5, 1)}, etc.

Wait, but earlier when n = 4, m = 1 gives 65/3, which is not integer. So, m = 1 only works for n where n - 1 divides n - 1, which is always true, but mn - 1 must be positive, so n ≥ 2.

Wait, but when n = 4, mn - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3, which divides n - 1 = 3. So, 3 divides 3, which is true. So, (m, n) = (1, 4) is a solution because 3 divides
