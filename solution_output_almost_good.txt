<|user|>Find all ordered pairs $(m,n)$ where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers such that $\frac{n^3 + 1}{mn - 1}$ is an integer. 

Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find all ordered pairs of positive integers (m, n) such that the expression (n³ + 1)/(mn - 1) is an integer. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, let me write down the given condition:

(n³ + 1) divided by (mn - 1) must be an integer. So, mathematically, that means (mn - 1) divides (n³ + 1). In other words, there exists some integer k such that:

n³ + 1 = k(mn - 1)

Since m and n are positive integers, and mn - 1 must be a positive divisor of n³ + 1. So, mn - 1 > 0, which implies that mn > 1. Since m and n are positive integers, the smallest they can be is 1, but mn must be at least 2. So, either m or n must be at least 2.

Let me rearrange the equation:

n³ + 1 = kmn - k

Bring all terms to one side:

n³ - kmn + (1 + k) = 0

Hmm, not sure if that helps directly. Maybe I can express m in terms of n and k?

From the equation n³ + 1 = k(mn - 1), let's solve for m:

n³ + 1 = kmn - k

Bring the k to the left:

n³ + 1 + k = kmn

Then, divide both sides by kn:

(n³ + 1 + k)/(kn) = m

So, m = (n³ + 1 + k)/(kn)

Since m must be a positive integer, (n³ + 1 + k) must be divisible by kn. So, kn divides (n³ + 1 + k). Hmm, that seems a bit abstract. Maybe I can think about it differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that n³ + 1 can be factored. Remember that n³ + 1 is a sum of cubes, so it factors as (n + 1)(n² - n + 1). So, n³ + 1 = (n + 1)(n² - n + 1). Therefore, mn - 1 must divide (n + 1)(n² - n + 1).

So, mn - 1 is a divisor of (n + 1)(n² - n + 1). Since mn - 1 is a linear term in m and n, maybe I can find possible values of m by considering the divisors of (n + 1)(n² - n + 1).

But mn - 1 must divide (n + 1)(n² - n + 1). So, mn - 1 is a positive divisor of (n + 1)(n² - n + 1). Therefore, mn - 1 must be less than or equal to (n + 1)(n² - n + 1). But since m and n are positive integers, mn - 1 is at least m*1 - 1 = m - 1. So, m - 1 <= (n + 1)(n² - n + 1). Hmm, not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider that mn - 1 divides n³ + 1, so there exists an integer k such that n³ + 1 = k(mn - 1). So, k = (n³ + 1)/(mn - 1). Since k must be a positive integer, mn - 1 must be a positive divisor of n³ + 1.

Therefore, mn - 1 divides n³ + 1, so mn - 1 must be one of the divisors of n³ + 1. The divisors of n³ + 1 can be found from its prime factorization, but since n is a variable, maybe it's better to think in terms of possible mn - 1 values.

Alternatively, perhaps I can perform polynomial division or use the Euclidean algorithm to find the relationship between n³ + 1 and mn - 1.

Let me try polynomial division: divide n³ + 1 by mn - 1.

Wait, but mn - 1 is a linear polynomial in m, but n is a variable as well. Hmm, maybe that's not straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express n³ + 1 in terms of mn - 1. Let me write n³ + 1 as (mn - 1)*q + r, where q is the quotient and r is the remainder. But since mn - 1 is a linear term, the remainder would be a constant.

Wait, actually, let's consider n as a variable and m as a coefficient. So, n³ + 1 divided by (mn - 1). Let me perform the division.

Divide n³ + 1 by mn - 1.

First term: n³ divided by mn is (n²)/m. Multiply (mn - 1) by (n²)/m: n³ - (n²)/m.

Subtract this from n³ + 1: [n³ + 1] - [n³ - (n²)/m] = (n²)/m + 1.

Now, the remainder is (n²)/m + 1. Since we're dealing with polynomials, the remainder should have a degree less than the divisor. The divisor is degree 1, so the remainder should be a constant. But here, the remainder is (n²)/m + 1, which is degree 2. Hmm, that suggests that my initial approach might not be the best.

Alternatively, maybe I should treat m as a variable and n as a constant. Let me try that.

So, treating m as the variable, the expression is (n³ + 1)/(mn - 1). For this to be an integer, mn - 1 must divide n³ + 1. So, mn - 1 divides n³ + 1, meaning that mn - 1 is a divisor of n³ + 1.

Therefore, mn - 1 must be a positive divisor of n³ + 1. So, mn - 1 can be any of the divisors d of n³ + 1, and then m = (d + 1)/n.

Since m must be a positive integer, (d + 1) must be divisible by n. So, for each divisor d of n³ + 1, if (d + 1) is divisible by n, then m = (d + 1)/n is a positive integer, and (m, n) is a solution.

Therefore, the strategy is:

1. For each positive integer n, find all positive divisors d of n³ + 1.
2. For each such divisor d, check if (d + 1) is divisible by n.
3. If yes, then m = (d + 1)/n is a positive integer, and (m, n) is a solution.

So, let's try this approach for small values of n and see if we can find a pattern or maybe all solutions.

Let's start with n = 1:

n = 1:

n³ + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2.

Divisors of 2: 1, 2.

Check each divisor d:

d = 1:

Check if (1 + 1) is divisible by 1: 2 is divisible by 1, yes. So, m = (1 + 1)/1 = 2. So, (2, 1) is a solution.

d = 2:

Check if (2 + 1) is divisible by 1: 3 is divisible by 1, yes. So, m = (2 + 1)/1 = 3. So, (3, 1) is a solution.

So, for n = 1, we have two solutions: (2, 1) and (3, 1).

Wait, but let me check if these actually satisfy the original condition.

For (2, 1):

(1³ + 1)/(2*1 - 1) = (1 + 1)/(2 - 1) = 2/1 = 2, which is an integer. Good.

For (3, 1):

(1 + 1)/(3*1 - 1) = 2/2 = 1, which is an integer. Good.

Okay, so n = 1 gives us two solutions.

Now, n = 2:

n³ + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9.

Divisors of 9: 1, 3, 9.

Check each d:

d = 1:

(1 + 1)/2 = 2/2 = 1, which is integer. So, m = 1. So, (1, 2) is a solution.

d = 3:

(3 + 1)/2 = 4/2 = 2, integer. So, m = 2. So, (2, 2) is a solution.

d = 9:

(9 + 1)/2 = 10/2 = 5, integer. So, m = 5. So, (5, 2) is a solution.

Check these:

(2³ + 1)/(1*2 - 1) = 9/1 = 9, integer.

(8 + 1)/(2*2 - 1) = 9/3 = 3, integer.

(8 + 1)/(5*2 - 1) = 9/9 = 1, integer.

All good. So, n = 2 gives us three solutions: (1, 2), (2, 2), (5, 2).

Moving on to n = 3:

n³ + 1 = 27 + 1 = 28.

Divisors of 28: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28.

Check each d:

d = 1:

(1 + 1)/3 = 2/3, not integer. So, discard.

d = 2:

(2 + 1)/3 = 3/3 = 1, integer. So, m = 1. So, (1, 3) is a solution.

d = 4:

(4 + 1)/3 = 5/3, not integer. Discard.

d = 7:

(7 + 1)/3 = 8/3, not integer. Discard.

d = 14:

(14 + 1)/3 = 15/3 = 5, integer. So, m = 5. So, (5, 3) is a solution.

d = 28:

(28 + 1)/3 = 29/3, not integer. Discard.

So, for n = 3, we have two solutions: (1, 3) and (5, 3).

Check them:

(27 + 1)/(1*3 - 1) = 28/2 = 14, integer.

(27 + 1)/(5*3 - 1) = 28/14 = 2, integer.

Good.

n = 4:

n³ + 1 = 64 + 1 = 65.

Divisors of 65: 1, 5, 13, 65.

Check each d:

d = 1:

(1 + 1)/4 = 2/4 = 1/2, not integer.

d = 5:

(5 + 1)/4 = 6/4 = 3/2, not integer.

d = 13:

(13 + 1)/4 = 14/4 = 7/2, not integer.

d = 65:

(65 + 1)/4 = 66/4 = 33/2, not integer.

So, for n = 4, there are no solutions.

Hmm, interesting. So, n = 4 gives no solutions.

n = 5:

n³ + 1 = 125 + 1 = 126.

Divisors of 126: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, 14, 18, 21, 42, 63, 126.

Check each d:

d = 1:

(1 + 1)/5 = 2/5, not integer.

d = 2:

(2 + 1)/5 = 3/5, not integer.

d = 3:

(3 + 1)/5 = 4/5, not integer.

d = 6:

(6 + 1)/5 = 7/5, not integer.

d = 7:

(7 + 1)/5 = 8/5, not integer.

d = 9:

(9 + 1)/5 = 10/5 = 2, integer. So, m = 2. So, (2, 5) is a solution.

d = 14:

(14 + 1)/5 = 15/5 = 3, integer. So, m = 3. So, (3, 5) is a solution.

d = 18:

(18 + 1)/5 = 19/5, not integer.

d = 21:

(21 + 1)/5 = 22/5, not integer.

d = 4<|im_end|> Final Answer: The ordered pairs are \boxed{(1, 2)}, \boxed{(2, 1)}, \boxed{(2, 2)}, \boxed{(3, 1)}, \boxed{(5, 2)}, \boxed{(1, 3)}, \boxed{(5, 3)}, \boxed{(2, 5)}, and \boxed{(3, 5)}.

Wait, hold on. When n = 5, we found (2,5) and (3,5). Let me verify these:

For (2,5):

(125 + 1)/(2*5 - 1) = 126/9 = 14, integer.

For (3,5):

(125 + 1)/(3*5 - 1) = 126/14 = 9, integer.

Good.

n = 6:

n³ + 1 = 216 + 1 = 217.

Divisors of 217: 1, 7, 31, 217.

Check each d:

d = 1:

(1 + 1)/6 = 2/6 = 1/3, not integer.

d = 7:

(7 + 1)/6 = 8/6 = 4/3, not integer.

d = 31:

(31 + 1)/6 = 32/6 = 16/3, not integer.

d = 217:

(217 + 1)/6 = 218/6 = 109/3, not integer.

So, n = 6 gives no solutions.

n = 7:

n³ + 1 = 343 + 1 = 344.

Divisors of 344: Let's factorize 344.

344 divided by 2 is 172.

172 divided by 2 is 86.

86 divided by 2 is 43.

43 is prime.

So, 344 = 2³ * 43.

Therefore, divisors are 1, 2, 4, 8, 43, 86, 172, 344.

Check each d:

d = 1:
