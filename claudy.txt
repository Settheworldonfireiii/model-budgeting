Alright, so I came across this problem: "Who are you? Find all ordered pairs $(m,n)$ where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers such that $\frac{n^3 + 1}{mn - 1}$ is an integer." At first glance, it seems a bit intimidating, but I think I can break it down step by step.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We need to find all pairs of positive integers $(m, n)$ such that when we compute $\frac{n^3 + 1}{mn - 1}$, the result is also an integer. So, essentially, $mn - 1$ must divide $n^3 + 1$ without leaving any remainder.

Hmm, okay. So, mathematically, this means that $mn - 1$ is a divisor of $n^3 + 1$. In other words, $mn - 1$ divides $n^3 + 1$, which can be written as:

$$
mn - 1 \mid n^3 + 1
$$

I remember that if a number $a$ divides another number $b$, then there exists some integer $k$ such that $b = a \cdot k$. So, applying that here, we can write:

$$
n^3 + 1 = (mn - 1) \cdot k
$$

where $k$ is some positive integer because both $m$ and $n$ are positive integers, and $mn - 1$ must be positive as well (since $m$ and $n$ are at least 1, $mn$ is at least 1, so $mn - 1$ is at least 0, but since $m$ and $n$ are positive integers, $mn$ is at least 1, so $mn - 1$ is at least 0, but actually, if $m = 1$ and $n = 1$, then $mn - 1 = 0$, which can't divide anything. So, $mn - 1$ must be at least 1. Therefore, $mn - 1 \geq 1$, which implies $mn \geq 2$. So, $m$ and $n$ must be at least 1, but their product must be at least 2. So, either one of them is 1 and the other is at least 2, or both are at least 2.

Alright, moving on. So, we have:

$$
n^3 + 1 = (mn - 1) \cdot k
$$

Let me Now, here is the final answer: I need to find all positive integers $m$ and $n$ such that $mn - 1$ divides $n^3 + 1$. So, perhaps I can rearrange this equation to express $k$ in terms of $m$ and $n$, but I'm not sure if that's helpful yet.

Alternatively, maybe I can perform polynomial division or factorization on $n^3 + 1$ to see if $mn - 1$ is a factor. Let me recall that $n^3 + 1$ can be factored as:

$$
n^3 + 1 = (n + 1)(n^2 - n + 1)
$$

Yes, that's correct. So, $n^3 + 1$ factors into $(n + 1)(n^2 - n + 1)$. So, if $mn - 1$ divides $(n + 1)(n^2 - n + 1)$, then $mn - 1$ must be a product of some combination of the factors of $(n + 1)$ and $(n^2 - n + 1)$.

But since $mn - 1$ is a linear term in $m$ and $n$, it's not immediately clear how to proceed. Maybe I can express $k$ as:

$$
k = \frac{n^3 + 1}{mn - 1}
$$

And since $k$ must be an integer, perhaps I can find constraints on $m$ and $n$ by analyzing this expression.

Alternatively, maybe I can perform the division of $n^3 + 1$ by $mn - 1$ and see what conditions that imposes on $m$ and $n$.

Let me try polynomial long division. Let's divide $n^3 + 1$ by $mn - 1$.

Wait, but $mn - 1$ is a linear polynomial in $n$, but $n^3 + 1$ is a cubic polynomial in $n$. So, perhaps I can express $n^3 + 1$ as $(mn - 1) \cdot q(n) + r$, where $q(n)$ is the quotient and $r$ is the remainder.

But since $mn - 1$ is linear in $n$, the remainder $r$ will be a constant with respect to $n$. So,
