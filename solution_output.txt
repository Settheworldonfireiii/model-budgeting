Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find all ordered pairs of positive integers (m, n) such that the expression (n³ + 1)/(mn - 1) is an integer. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, let me write down the given condition:

(n³ + 1) divided by (mn - 1) must be an integer. So, mathematically, that means (mn - 1) divides (n³ + 1). In other words, there exists some integer k such that:

n³ + 1 = k(mn - 1)

Since m and n are positive integers, and mn - 1 must be a positive divisor of n³ + 1, because both numerator and denominator are positive. So, mn - 1 > 0, which implies that mn > 1. Since m and n are positive integers, the smallest they can be is 1, but mn must be at least 2. So, either m or n must be at least 2.

Let me rearrange the equation:

n³ + 1 = kmn - k

Bring all terms to one side:

n³ - kmn + (1 + k) = 0

Hmm, not sure if that helps directly. Maybe I can express m in terms of n and k?

From the equation n³ + 1 = k(mn - 1), let's solve for m:

n³ + 1 = kmn - k

Bring the k to the left:

n³ + 1 + k = kmn

Then, divide both sides by kn:

(n³ + 1 + k)/(kn) = m

So, m = (n³ + 1 + k)/(kn)

Since m must be a positive integer, (n³ + 1 + k) must be divisible by kn. So, kn divides (n³ + 1 + k). Hmm, that seems a bit abstract. Maybe I can think about it differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that if mn - 1 divides n³ + 1, then mn - 1 must be a divisor of n³ + 1. So, mn - 1 | n³ + 1.

I remember that in number theory, if a number d divides another number a, then d must be less than or equal to a in absolute value, unless a is zero. But here, both mn - 1 and n³ + 1 are positive, so mn - 1 must be less than or equal to n³ + 1.

So, mn - 1 ≤ n³ + 1

Which implies mn ≤ n³ + 2

Divide both sides by n (since n is positive, we can do that):

m ≤ n² + 2/n

Since m is a positive integer, 2/n must be less than 1, so n must be at least 3? Wait, no. If n is 1, 2/n is 2, which is an integer. If n is 2, 2/n is 1, which is also an integer. If n is 3, 2/3 is less than 1. So, for n ≥ 3, 2/n < 1, so m ≤ n² + something less than 1, so m ≤ n².

But for n = 1, m ≤ 1 + 2 = 3

For n = 2, m ≤ 4 + 1 = 5

So, maybe I can consider small values of n and find possible m.

Let me try n = 1 first.

Case 1: n = 1

Then, the expression becomes (1 + 1)/(m*1 - 1) = 2/(m - 1). We need this to be an integer, so m - 1 must divide 2. The positive divisors of 2 are 1 and 2.

So, m - 1 = 1 => m = 2

Or, m - 1 = 2 => m = 3

So, for n = 1, possible m are 2 and 3. So, ordered pairs are (2,1) and (3,1).

Case 2: n = 2

Expression: (8 + 1)/(2m - 1) = 9/(2m - 1). So, 2m - 1 must divide 9.

Divisors of 9 are 1, 3, 9.

So, 2m - 1 = 1 => 2m = 2 => m = 1

2m - 1 = 3 => 2m = 4 => m = 2

2m - 1 = 9 => 2m = 10 => m = 5

So, for n = 2, m can be 1, 2, 5. So, ordered pairs are (1,2), (2,2), (5,2).

Case 3: n = 3

Expression: (27 + 1)/(3m - 1) = 28/(3m - 1). So, 3m - 1 must divide 28.

Divisors of 28 are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28.

So, 3m - 1 = 1 => 3m = 2 => m = 2/3, not integer.

3m - 1 = 2 => 3m = 3 => m = 1

3m - 1 = 4 => 3m = 5 => m = 5/3, not integer.

3m - 1 = 7 => 3m = 8 => m = 8/3, not integer.

3m - 1 = 14 => 3m = 15 => m = 5

3m - 1 = 28 => 3m = 29 => m = 29/3, not integer.

So, for n = 3, m can be 1 and 5. So, ordered pairs are (1,3) and (5,3).

Case 4: n = 4

Expression: (64 + 1)/(4m - 1) = 65/(4m - 1). So, 4m - 1 must divide 65.

Divisors of 65 are 1, 5, 13, 65.

So, 4m - 1 = 1 => 4m = 2 => m = 0.5, not integer.

4m - 1 = 5 => 4m = 6 => m = 1.5, not integer.

4m - 1 = 13 => 4m = 14 => m = 3.5, not integer.

4m - 1 = 65 => 4m = 66 => m = 16.5, not integer.

Hmm, so for n = 4, there are no integer solutions for m. So, no ordered pairs here.

Case 5: n = 5

Expression: (125 + 1)/(5m - 1) = 126/(5m - 1). So, 5m - 1 must divide 126.

Divisors of 126 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, 14, 18, 21, 42, 63, 126.

So, let's check each:

5m - 1 = 1 => 5m = 2 => m = 0.4, not integer.

5m - 1 = 2 => 5m = 3 => m = 0.6, not integer.

5m - 1 = 3 => 5m = 4 => m = 0.8, not integer.

5m - 1 = 6 => 5m = 7 => m = 1.4, not integer.

5m - 1 = 7 => 5m = 8 => m = 1.6, not integer.

5m - 1 = 9 => 5m = 10 => m = 2

5m - 1 = 14 => 5m = 15 => m = 3

5m - 1 = 18 => 5m = 19 => m = 3.8, not integer.

5m - 1 = 21 => 5m = 22 => m = 4.4, not integer.

5m - 1 = 42 => 5m = 43 => m = 8.6, not integer.

5m - 1 = 63 => 5m = 64 => m = 12.8, not integer.

5m - 1 = 126 => 5m = 127 => m = 25.4, not integer.

So, for n = 5, m can be 2 and 3. So, ordered pairs are (2,5) and (3,5).

Case 6: n = 6

Expression: (216 + 1)/(6m - 1) = 217/(6m - 1). So, 6m - 1 must divide 217.

217 is a prime? Wait, 217 divided by 7 is 31, because 7*31 = 217. So, divisors are 1, 7, 31, 217.

So, 6m - 1 = 1 => 6m = 2 => m = 1/3, not integer.

6m - 1 = 7 => 6m = 8 => m = 8/6 = 4/3, not integer.

6m - 1 = 31 => 6m = 32 => m = 32/6 = 16/3, not integer.

6m - 1 = 217 => 6m = 218 => m = 218/6 = 109/3, not integer.

So, no solutions for n = 6.

Case 7: n = 7

Expression: (343 + 1)/(7m - 1) = 344/(7m - 1). So, 7m - 1 must divide 344.

Divisors of 344: Let's factorize 344.

344 divided by 2 is 172

172 divided by 2 is 86

86 divided by 2 is 43

43 is prime.

So, prime factors are 2³ * 43. So, divisors are 1, 2, 4, 8, 43, 86, 172, 344.

So, 7m - 1 can be each of these:

7m - 1 = 1 => 7m = 2 => m = 2/7, not integer.

7m - 1 = 2 => 7m = 3 => m = 3/7, not integer.

7m - 1 = 4 => 7m = 5 => m = 5/7, not integer.

7m - 1 = 8 => 7m = 9 => m = 9/7, not integer.

7m - 1 = 43 => 7m = 44 => m = 44/7 ≈ 6.285, not integer.

7m - 1 = 86 => 7m = 87 => m = 87/7 ≈ 12.428, not integer.

7m - 1 = 172 => 7m = 173 => m = 173/7 ≈ 24.714, not integer.

7m - 1 = 344 => 7m = 345 => m = 345/7 ≈ 49.285, not integer.

So, no solutions for n = 7.

Case 8: n = 8

Expression: (512 + 1)/(8m - 1) = 513/(8m - 1). So, 8m - 1 must divide 513.

Factorize 513: 513 divided by 3 is 171, divided by 3 is 57, divided by 3 is 19. So, 513 = 3³ * 19.

Divisors are 1, 3, 9, 19, 27, 57, 171, 513.

So, 8m - 1 can be each of these:

8m - 1 = 1 => 8m = 2 => m = 0.25, not integer.

8m - 1 = 3 => 8m = 4 => m = 0.5, not integer.

8m - 1 = 9 => 8m = 10 => m = 1.25, not integer.

8m - 1 = 19 => 8m =<|im_end|> Final Answer: The ordered pairs are \boxed{(2,1)}, \boxed{(3,1)}, \boxed{(1,2)}, \boxed{(2,2)}, \boxed{(5,2)}, \boxed{(1,3)}, \boxed{(5,3)}, \boxed{(2,5)}, and \boxed{(3,5)}.
