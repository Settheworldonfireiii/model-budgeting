First, let's determine how much money Bob has after making five times his investment. Since Bob initially invested $2000 and made five times that amount, his total is $2000 multiplied by 5, which equals $10,000.

Next, we know that Bob has $8000 more than Alice. Let's denote Alice's final amount as \( A \). According to the problem, \( A + 8000 = 10,000 \). Solving for \( A \), we find that Alice's final amount is $2,000.

Finally, to find the ratio of Alice's final amount to her initial investment, we divide her final amount by her initial investment: \( \frac{2000}{2000} = 1 \). Therefore, the ratio is 1:1.

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Alice and Bob each start with \$2000.
- Alice invests all her money in the stock market and increases her money by a certain factor.
- Bob invests in real estate and makes five times more money than he invested.
- Bob has \$8000 more than Alice now.

**Let's denote:**
- \( A \) as Alice's final amount.
- \( B \) as Bob's final amount.

**Step 1: Calculate Bob's Final Amount**

Bob invests \$2000 in real estate and makes five times his investment. Therefore:
\[
B = 2000 \times 5 = 10,\!000
\]

**Step 2: Relate Bob's and Alice's Final Amounts**

According to the problem, Bob has \$8000 more than Alice:
\[
B = A + 8,\!000
\]
Substitute the value of \( B \) from Step 1:
\[
10,\!000 = A + 8,\!000

Okay, so Alice and Bob each start with \$2000. Alice invests all her money in the stock market and increases her investment by a certain factor. Bob invests in real estate and makes five times more money than he invested. Bob has \$8000 more than Alice now. We need to find the ratio of Alice's final amount to her initial investment.

First, let's figure out how much Bob has after making five times his investment. If Bob invests \$2000 in real estate and makes five times that amount, his total is:
\[
2000 \times 5 = 10,\!000
\]

Next, we know that Bob has \$8000 more than Alice. Let's denote Alice's final amount as \( A \). According to the problem:
\[
10,\!000 = A + 8,\!000
\]
Solving for \( A \):
\[
A = 10,\!000 - 8,\!000 = 2,\!000
\]

So, Alice's final amount is \$2000. Since Alice started with \$2000, the ratio of her final amount to her initial investment is:
\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{2,\!000}{2,\!000} = 1
\]

Therefore, the ratio is 1:1.

Okay, so Alice and Bob each start with \$2000. Alice invests all her money in the stock market and increases her investment by a certain factor. Bob invests in real estate and makes five times more money than he invested. Bob has \$8000 more than Alice now.

First, let's figure out how much Bob has after making five times his investment. If Bob invests \$2000 in real estate and makes five times that amount, his total is:
\[
2000 \times 5 = 10,\!000
\]

Next, we know that Bob has \$8000 more than Alice. Let's denote Alice's final amount as \( A \). According to the problem:
\[
10,\!000 = A + 8,\!000
\]
Solving for \( A \):
\[
A = 10,\!000 - 8,\!000 = 2,\!000
\]

So, Alice's final amount is \$2000. Since Alice started with \$2000, the ratio of her final amount to her initial investment is:
\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{2,\!000}{2,\!000} = 1

Next, we know that Bob has \$8000 more than Alice. Let's denote Alice's final amount as \( A \). According to the problem:
\[
10,\!000 = A + 8,\!000
\]
Solving for \( A \):
\[
A = 10,\!000 - 8,\!000 = 2,\!000
\]

So, Alice's final amount is \$2000. Since Alice started with \$2000, the ratio of her final amount to her initial investment is:
\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{2,\!000}{2,\!000} = 1
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{1}
\]

Alice and Bob each start with \$2000. Alice invests all her money in the stock market and increases her investment by a certain factor. Bob invests in real estate and makes five times more money than he invested. Bob has \$8000 more than Alice now.

First, let's figure out how much Bob has after making five times his investment. If Bob invests \$2000 in real estate and makes five times that amount, his total is:
\[
2000 \times 5 = 10,\!000
\]

Next, we know that Bob has \$8000 more than Alice. Let's denote Alice's final amount as \( A \). According to the problem:
