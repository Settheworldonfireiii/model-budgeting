What is the ratio of Alice&apos;s final amount to her initial investment?<｜Assistant｜><think>
To determine the ratio of Alice's final amount to her initial investment, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, Alice invests all her $2000 in the stock market and increases her money by a certain factor. Let's denote this factor as \( x \). Therefore, Alice's final amount is \( 2000 \times x \).

Bob, on the other hand, invests in real estate and makes five times more money than his initial investment. Since Bob also started with $2000, his final amount is \( 2000 \times 5 = 10000 \).

According to the problem, Bob has $8000 more than Alice after their investments. This gives us the equation:
\[ 10000 = 2000x + 8000 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 2000x = 10000 - 8000 \]
\[ 2000x = 2000 \]
\[ x = 1 \]

This means Alice's final amount is \( 2000 \times 1 = 2000 \). Therefore, the ratio of Alice's final amount to her initial investment is:
\[ \frac{2000}{2000} = 1 \]

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Alice invests \$2000 in the stock market and increases her money by a factor of \( x \).
- Bob invests \$2000 in real estate and makes five times more money than he invested.
- Bob has \$8000 more than Alice after their investments.

**Let's denote:**
- Alice's final amount as \( A \).
- Bob's final amount as \( B \).

**Step 1: Express Alice's and Bob's final amounts in terms of \( x \).**

- **Alice:**
  - Initial investment: \$2000
  - Increase factor: \( x \)
  - Final amount: \( A = 2000 \times x \)

- **Bob:**
  - Initial investment: \$2000
  - Makes five times more money: \( 5 \times 2000 = 10000 \)
  - Final amount: \( B = 10000 \)

**Step 2: Set up the equation based on the given information.**

According to the problem, Bob has \$8000 more than Alice:
\[
B = A + 8000
\]
Substituting the expressions for \( A \) and \( B \):
\[
10000 = 2000x + 8000
\]

**Step 3: Solve for \( x \).**

\[
2000x = 10000 - 8000
\]
\[
2000x = 2000
\]
\[
x = \frac{2000}{2000} = 1
\]

**Step 4: Calculate Alice's final amount.**

\[
A = 2000 \times x = 2000 \times 1 = 2000
\]
