Okay, so Alice and Bob each have $2000 to invest. Alice decides to put all her money into the stock market and ends up with a certain factor increase. Bob, on the other hand, invests in real estate and makes five times more money than he invested. After their investments, Bob has $8000 more than Alice. We need to find the ratio of Alice's final amount to her initial investment.

Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's consider Alice's investment. She puts all her $2000 into the stock market and increases her money by a certain factor. Let's denote this factor as 'x'. So, if her initial investment is $2000, her final amount after the stock market would be 2000 multiplied by x. So, Alice's final amount is 2000x.

Now, moving on to Bob. He invests in real estate and makes five times more money than he invested. Wait, does that mean his profit is five times his investment, or does it mean his total amount is five times his investment? Hmm, the wording says "makes five times more money than he invested." So, if he invested $2000, and he makes five times more money, that would mean his profit is 5 times his investment. So, his profit is 5 * 2000 = $10,000. Therefore, his total amount would be his initial investment plus his profit, which is 2000 + 10,000 = $12,000.

Wait, but the problem says Bob has $8000 more than Alice now. So, Bob's final amount is $8000 more than Alice's final amount. So, if Alice's final amount is 2000x, then Bob's final amount is 2000x + 8000.

But earlier, I calculated Bob's final amount as $12,000. So, let's set up the equation:

2000x + 8000 = 12,000

Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. If Bob's final amount is $8000 more than Alice's, and Alice's final amount is 2000x, then Bob's final amount is 2000x + 8000. But Bob's final amount is also $12,000. So, yes, 2000x + 8000 = 12,000.

So, let's solve for x.

2000x + 8000 = 12,000

Subtract 8000 from both sides:

2000x = 12,000 - 8,000

2000x = 4,000

Divide both sides by 2000:

x = 4,000 / 2000

x = 2

So, x is 2. That means Alice's final amount is 2000 * 2 = $4,000.

But the question is asking for the ratio of Alice's final amount to her initial investment. Her initial investment was $2000, and her final amount is $4000. So, the ratio is 4000 / 2000, which simplifies to 2/1 or just 2.

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any mistakes.

So, Alice invests $2000 and ends up with 2000x. Bob invests $2000 and makes five times more money, so his profit is 5 * 2000 = $10,000, so his total is $12,000. The problem states that Bob has $8000 more than Alice now, so 12,000 = 2000x + 8000. Solving for x gives x = 2. Therefore, Alice's final amount is 2000 * 2 = 4000.<|im_end|> Final Answer: \boxed{2}

**Final Answer**
The ratio of Alice's final amount to her initial investment is \boxed{2}.
</think>

Alice invests $2000 in the stock market and increases her money by a factor of \( x \). Therefore, her final amount is \( 2000x \).

Bob invests $2000 in real estate and makes five times more money than he invested. This means his profit is \( 5 \times 2000 = 10000 \) dollars, so his total amount is \( 2000 + 10000 = 12000 \) dollars.

According to the problem, Bob has $8000 more than Alice. Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[
2000x + 8000 = 12000
\]

Solving for \( x \):
