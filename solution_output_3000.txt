Okay, so I need to find all ordered pairs of positive integers (m, n) such that the expression (n³ + 1)/(mn - 1) is an integer. Hmm, that sounds like a number theory problem. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, let's denote k as the integer value of the expression. So, we can write:

(n³ + 1)/(mn - 1) = k

Which implies that:

n³ + 1 = k(mn - 1)

Let me rearrange this equation:

n³ + 1 = kmn - k

Bringing all terms to one side:

n³ - kmn + (1 + k) = 0

Hmm, so we have a cubic equation in terms of n. Maybe I can factor this or find some relationship between m and n.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express m in terms of n and k. Let me try that.

From the equation:

n³ + 1 = k(mn - 1)

Let's solve for m:

n³ + 1 = kmn - k

Bring the kmn term to the left and the rest to the right:

kmn = n³ + 1 + k

So,

m = (n³ + 1 + k)/(kn)

Since m must be a positive integer, the numerator must be divisible by kn. So, kn divides n³ + 1 + k.

Let me write that as:

kn | (n³ + 1 + k)

Which means that (n³ + 1 + k) is a multiple of kn. So, there exists some integer t such that:

n³ + 1 + k = t * kn

Hmm, so:

n³ + 1 + k = t * kn

Let me rearrange this:

n³ + 1 = t * kn - k

Factor out k on the right side:

n³ + 1 = k(tn - 1)

Wait, that's interesting. So, n³ + 1 is equal to k times (tn - 1). But earlier, we had n³ + 1 = k(mn - 1). So, that suggests that tn - 1 = mn - 1, which would imply that t = m. So, t is equal to m.

Therefore, we can write:

n³ + 1 = k(mn - 1)

Which is consistent with our original equation. So, that doesn't give us new information. Maybe I need a different approach.

Let me think about the original equation again:

(n³ + 1)/(mn - 1) = k

Since m and n are positive integers, mn - 1 must be a positive divisor of n³ + 1. So, mn - 1 divides n³ + 1.

Therefore, mn - 1 | n³ + 1

Which implies that mn - 1 ≤ n³ + 1, because a divisor can't be larger than the number it divides unless the number is zero, which it isn't here.

So, mn - 1 ≤ n³ + 1

Which simplifies to:

mn ≤ n³ + 2

Divide both sides by n (since n is positive):

m ≤ n² + 2/n

But since m is an integer, and 2/n is less than or equal to 2 (since n is at least 1), m must be less than or equal to n² + 2.

But m is a positive integer, so m can be at most n² + 2.

Hmm, not sure if that's immediately helpful, but it's a bound on m.

Alternatively, maybe I can perform polynomial division or factor n³ + 1.

Wait, n³ + 1 factors as (n + 1)(n² - n + 1). So, maybe that can help.

So, (n³ + 1)/(mn - 1) = k

Which is equal to (n + 1)(n² - n + 1)/(mn - 1) = k

So, mn - 1 must divide (n + 1)(n² - n + 1). Since mn - 1 is a linear term in m, perhaps we can use the fact that mn - 1 divides (n + 1)(n² - n + 1).

Let me denote d = mn - 1. Then, d divides (n + 1)(n² - n + 1). So, d | (n + 1)(n² - n + 1). Also, since d = mn - 1, we can write m = (d + 1)/n.

Since m must be an integer, (d + 1) must be divisible by n. So, d ≡ -1 mod n.

But d divides (n + 1)(n² - n + 1). So, d must be a divisor of (n + 1)(n² - n + 1) that is congruent to -1 mod n.

Let me compute (n + 1)(n² - n + 1) modulo n.

First, n + 1 ≡ 1 mod n, because n ≡ 0 mod n, so n + 1 ≡ 1.

Similarly, n² - n + 1 ≡ 0 - 0 + 1 ≡ 1 mod n.

Therefore, (n + 1)(n² - n + 1) ≡ 1 * 1 ≡ 1 mod n.

So, (n + 1)(n² - n + 1) ≡ 1 mod n.

Therefore, d divides 1 mod n, which implies that d ≡ 1 mod n.

But d = mn - 1, so mn - 1 ≡ 1 mod n.

Which simplifies to mn ≡ 2 mod n.

But mn ≡ 0 mod n, since mn is a multiple of n. So, 0 ≡ 2 mod n, which implies that n divides 2.

Therefore, n must be a positive integer divisor of 2. So, n can be 1 or 2.

Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check.

We have d = mn - 1, and d divides (n + 1)(n² - n + 1). We found that (n + 1)(n² - n + 1) ≡ 1 mod n, so d ≡ 1 mod n.

But d = mn - 1, so mn - 1 ≡ 1 mod n, which is mn ≡ 2 mod n.

But mn is a multiple of n, so mn ≡ 0 mod n. Therefore, 0 ≡ 2 mod n, which implies that n divides 2.

Therefore, n must be 1 or 2.

So, n can only be 1 or 2. That's a significant restriction. So, let's consider these cases separately.

Case 1: n = 1

Then, let's plug n = 1 into the original expression:

(1³ + 1)/(m*1 - 1) = (1 + 1)/(m - 1) = 2/(m - 1)

This must be an integer. So, m - 1 must divide 2.

Therefore, m - 1 is a positive divisor of 2. The positive divisors of 2 are 1 and 2.

So, m - 1 = 1 => m = 2

Or, m - 1 = 2 => m = 3

Therefore, when n = 1, m can be 2 or 3.

So, the ordered pairs are (2, 1) and (3, 1).

Case 2: n = 2

Now, let's plug n = 2 into the original expression:

(2³ + 1)/(m*2 - 1) = (8 + 1)/(2m - 1) = 9/(2m - 1)

This must be an integer. So, 2m - 1 must divide 9.

The positive divisors of 9 are 1, 3, 9.

Therefore, 2m - 1 can be 1, 3, or 9.

Let's solve for m in each case:

1. 2m - 1 = 1 => 2m = 2 => m = 1

2. 2m - 1 = 3 => 2m = 4 => m = 2

3. 2m - 1 = 9 => 2m = 10 => m = 5

Therefore, when n = 2, m can be 1, 2, or 5.

So, the ordered pairs are (1, 2), (2, 2), and (5, 2).

So, combining both cases, the possible ordered pairs are:

(2, 1), (3, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (5, 2)

Wait, but let me check if these actually satisfy the original equation.

For (2, 1):

(1³ + 1)/(2*1 - 1) = (1 + 1)/1 = 2, which is integer. Good.

For (3, 1):

(1³ + 1)/(3*1 - 1) = 2/2 = 1, which is integer. Good.

For (1, 2):

(2³ + 1)/(1*2 - 1) = (8 + 1)/1 = 9, which is integer. Good.

For (2, 2):

(2³ + 1)/(2*2 - 1) = (8 + 1)/3 = 9/3 = 3, which is integer. Good.

For (5, 2):

(2³ + 1)/(5*2 - 1) = (8 + 1)/9 = 9/9 = 1, which is integer. Good.

So, all these pairs satisfy the condition.

But wait, earlier, I concluded that n must be 1 or 2 because n divides 2. So, n can only be 1 or 2. But is that the only possibility?

Wait, let me think again. When I said that (n + 1)(n² - n + 1) ≡ 1 mod n, which implies that d ≡ 1 mod n, and d = mn - 1. So, mn - 1 ≡ 1 mod n => mn ≡ 2 mod n => 0 ≡ 2 mod n => n divides 2. So, n must be 1 or 2.

Therefore, n can only be 1 or 2. So, there are no other possible values for n.

Therefore, the only possible ordered pairs are the ones we found: (2, 1), (3, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (5, 2).

Wait, but let me check if n can be greater than 2. Suppose n = 3.

If n = 3, let's see if there exists an m such that (27 + 1)/(3m - 1) = 28/(3m - 1) is integer.

So, 3m - 1 must divide 28. The positive divisors of 28 are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28.

So, 3m - 1 can be 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28.

Solving for m:

1. 3m - 1 = 1 => 3m = 2 => m = 2/3, not integer.

2. 3m - 1 = 2 => 3m = 3 => m = 1

3. 3m - 1 = 4 => 3m = 5 => m = 5/3, not integer.

4. 3m - 1 = 7 => 3m = 8 => m = 8/3, not integer.

5. 3m - 1 = 14 => 3m = 15 => m = 5

6. 3m - 1 = 28 => 3m = 29 => m = 29/3, not integer.

So, only m = 1 and m = 5 are possible. Let's check them:

For m = 1:

(27 + 1)/(3*1 - 1) = 28/2 = 14, which is integer. So, (1, 3) is a solution.

Wait, but earlier, I thought n must be 1 or 2. So, n = 3 is not allowed? But according to this, n = 3 is possible with m = 1.

Hmm, so my earlier conclusion that n must be 1 or 2 was incorrect. So, I need to revisit that.

Wait, let's go back to the step where I said that (n + 1)(n² - n + 1) ≡ 1 mod n, which implies that d ≡ 1 mod n, and d = mn - 1. So, mn - 1 ≡ 1 mod n => mn ≡ 2 mod n => 0 ≡ 2 mod n => n divides 2. So, n must be 1 or 2.

But in the case of n = 3, we found that m = 1 is a solution. So, that contradicts the earlier conclusion. Therefore, my reasoning must be flawed.

Wait, let's recast the problem.

<|im_end|> Final Answer: \boxed{(1, 3)}, \boxed{(2, 1)}, \boxed{(3, 1)}, \boxed{(1, 2)}, \boxed{(2, 2)}, \boxed{(5, 2)}.

Wait, but in the case of n = 3, m = 1 is a solution. So, n can be 1, 2, or 3? But according to the earlier reasoning, n must divide 2, so n can only be 1 or 2. So, why does n = 3 work?

Wait, perhaps my initial conclusion was wrong. Let me re-examine the step where I said that (n + 1)(n² - n + 1) ≡ 1 mod n.

Compute (n + 1)(n² - n + 1) mod n.

First, n + 1 ≡ 1 mod n.

Second, n² - n + 1 �
