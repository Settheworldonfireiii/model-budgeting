Okay, so I need to find all ordered pairs of positive integers (m, n) such that the expression (n³ + 1)/(mn - 1) is an integer. Hmm, that sounds like a number theory problem. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, let's denote k as the integer value of the expression. So, we can write:

(n³ + 1)/(mn - 1) = k

Which implies that:

n³ + 1 = k(mn - 1)

Let me rearrange this equation:

n³ + 1 = kmn - k

Bringing all terms to one side:

n³ - kmn + (1 + k) = 0

Hmm, so we have a cubic equation in terms of n. Maybe I can factor this or find some relationship between m and n.

Alternatively, maybe I can express m in terms of n and k. Let's try that.

From the original equation:

n³ + 1 = k(mn - 1)

Divide both sides by (mn - 1):

m = (n³ + 1)/(k(mn - 1))

Wait, that seems a bit circular because m is on both sides. Maybe another approach is needed.

Let me think about the division. Since (mn - 1) divides (n³ + 1), there must be some integer k such that n³ + 1 = k(mn - 1). So, mn - 1 must be a divisor of n³ + 1.

Therefore, mn - 1 divides n³ + 1. So, mn - 1 | n³ + 1.

I remember that if a divides b, then a divides any linear combination of a and b. So, maybe I can find such a combination here.

Let me compute n³ + 1 divided by mn - 1. Let's perform polynomial division or use the Euclidean algorithm for polynomials.

Wait, n³ + 1 can be factored as (n + 1)(n² - n + 1). Maybe that helps?

So, n³ + 1 = (n + 1)(n² - n + 1). So, mn - 1 divides (n + 1)(n² - n + 1). Therefore, mn - 1 must be a divisor of (n + 1)(n² - n + 1).

Since mn - 1 is a positive integer (because m and n are positive integers), it must be a positive divisor of (n + 1)(n² - n + 1).

So, mn - 1 divides (n + 1)(n² - n + 1). Therefore, mn - 1 must be less than or equal to (n + 1)(n² - n + 1), which is obvious because mn - 1 is positive.

But perhaps more importantly, mn - 1 must be a factor of (n + 1)(n² - n + 1). So, mn - 1 must be one of the divisors of (n + 1)(n² - n + 1).

Let me denote d = mn - 1. Then, d divides (n + 1)(n² - n + 1). So, d | (n + 1)(n² - n + 1). Therefore, d is a positive divisor of (n + 1)(n² - n + 1). So, d can be written as a product of some combination of the prime factors of (n + 1) and (n² - n + 1).

But since d = mn - 1, we can write m = (d + 1)/n. Since m must be a positive integer, (d + 1) must be divisible by n. So, n divides (d + 1). Therefore, d ≡ -1 mod n.

But d is a divisor of (n + 1)(n² - n + 1). So, d divides (n + 1)(n² - n + 1), and d ≡ -1 mod n.

Hmm, this seems a bit abstract. Maybe I can try small values of n and see if I can find a pattern or possible m.

Let me try n = 1.

If n = 1, then the expression becomes (1 + 1)/(m*1 - 1) = 2/(m - 1). For this to be an integer, m - 1 must divide 2. So, m - 1 can be 1 or 2. Therefore, m = 2 or 3.

So, for n = 1, m can be 2 or 3. So, the ordered pairs are (2, 1) and (3, 1).

Let me check:

For (2, 1): (1 + 1)/(2*1 - 1) = 2/1 = 2, which is integer.

For (3, 1): (1 + 1)/(3*1 - 1) = 2/2 = 1, which is integer.

Okay, that works.

Now, n = 2.

Compute (8 + 1)/(2m - 1) = 9/(2m - 1). For this to be integer, 2m - 1 must divide 9.

Divisors of 9 are 1, 3, 9. So, 2m - 1 can be 1, 3, or 9.

Case 1: 2m - 1 = 1 => 2m = 2 => m = 1.

Case 2: 2m - 1 = 3 => 2m = 4 => m = 2.

Case 3: 2m - 1 = 9 => 2m = 10 => m = 5.

So, m can be 1, 2, or 5.

Let me check each:

For (1, 2): (8 + 1)/(1*2 - 1) = 9/1 = 9, integer.

For (2, 2): (8 + 1)/(2*2 - 1) = 9/3 = 3, integer.

For (5, 2): (8 + 1)/(5*2 - 1) = 9/9 = 1, integer.

So, all three are valid. So, ordered pairs are (1, 2), (2, 2), (5, 2).

Moving on to n = 3.

Compute (27 + 1)/(3m - 1) = 28/(3m - 1). So, 3m - 1 must divide 28.

Divisors of 28 are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28.

So, 3m - 1 can be 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28.

Case 1: 3m - 1 = 1 => 3m = 2 => m = 2/3, not integer.

Case 2: 3m - 1 = 2 => 3m = 3 => m = 1.

Case 3: 3m - 1 = 4 => 3m = 5 => m = 5/3, not integer.

Case 4: 3m - 1 = 7 => 3m = 8 => m = 8/3, not integer.

Case 5: 3m - 1 = 14 => 3m = 15 => m = 5.

Case 6: 3m - 1 = 28 => 3m = 29 => m = 29/3, not integer.

So, only m = 1 and m = 5 are possible.

Check:

For (1, 3): (27 + 1)/(1*3 - 1) = 28/2 = 14, integer.

For (5, 3): (27 + 1)/(5*3 - 1) = 28/14 = 2, integer.

So, ordered pairs are (1, 3) and (5, 3).

Hmm, interesting. So, for n = 1, 2, 3, we have some solutions.

Let me try n = 4.

Compute (64 + 1)/(4m - 1) = 65/(4m - 1). So, 4m - 1 must divide 65.

So, 4m - 1 can be 1, 5, 13, 65.

Case 1: 4m - 1 = 1 => 4m = 2 => m = 0.5, not integer.

Case 2: 4m - 1 = 5 => 4m = 6 => m = 1.5, not integer.

Case 3: 4m - 1 = 13 => 4m = 14 => m = 3.5, not integer.

Case 4: 4m - 1 = 65 => 4m = 66 => m = 16.5, not integer.

So, no solutions for n = 4.

Hmm, okay. Let's try n = 5.

Divisors of 126 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, 14, 18, 21, 42, 63, 126.

So, 5m - 1 can be any of these.

Case 1: 5m - 1 = 1 => 5m = 2 => m = 2/5, not integer.

Case 2: 5m - 1 = 2 => 5m = 3 => m = 3/5, not integer.

Case 11: 5m - 1 = 63 => 5m = 64 => m = 64/5, not integer.

Case 12: 5m - 1 = 126 => 5m = 127 => m = 127/5, not integer.

So, only m = 2 and m = 3 are possible.

Check:

For (2, 5): (125 + 1)/(2*5 - 1) = 126/9 = 14, integer.

For (3, 5): (125 + 1)/(3*5 - 1) = 126/14 = 9, integer.

So, ordered pairs are (2, 5) and (3, 5).

Hmm, so for n = 5, we have two solutions.

Case 4: 6m - 1 = 217 => 6m = 218 => m = 218/6 = 109/3, not integer.

So, no solutions for n = 6.
